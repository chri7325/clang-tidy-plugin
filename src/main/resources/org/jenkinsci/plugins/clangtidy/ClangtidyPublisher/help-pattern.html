<p style="margin-top: 0px;">Clangtidy must be executed to generate XML reports for this plugin to function.
<a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html">Fileset
'includes'</a> setting specifies the generated Clangtidy XML report files,
such as '**/clangtidy-result-*.xml'. Base directory of the fileset is relative
to the workspace root directory.</p>

<p>If no value is set, then the default '**/clangtidy-result.xml' will be used.
Be sure to never include any non-report files into this pattern.</p>

<p>The plugin is able to work with both XML formats produced by Clangtidy,
but always prefer to use the newer version 2. Clangtidy doesn't report some
issues with the legacy format.</p>
