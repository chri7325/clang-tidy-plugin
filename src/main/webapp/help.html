    <p>TODO : Add explication about clangtidy export</p>

    <p>You need to set up your build to run Clangtidy in order to use
        this feature - this Jenkins plug-in does not perform the actual analysis!
        This plug-in is not invoked for failed builds, it is only called for
        stable or unstable builds (i.e., a build with failed tests).</p>
